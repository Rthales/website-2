# Introduction

The COVID Tracking Project  obtains, organizes, and publishes high-quality data required to understand and respond to the COVID-19 outbreak in the United States.

There are a few core tenets that guide our work:

 - **Data quality comes first.** Our engine is the capture and standardization of the variable data that states produce. Our unique cross-functional team does the thing that no one else wants to or can do. It’s grueling, but it generates an extremely valuable dataset. 
 - We provide an **inclusive, healthy, supportive** work environment for everyone involved
 - **We operate with maximal openness**, while actively working to make sure our data is used responsibly.
 - **We maximize value for our network**, not for ourselves.
 - We support other organizations’ work to provide transparency and accountability for COVID-19 data, regardless of whether they are in industry, government, or media.
